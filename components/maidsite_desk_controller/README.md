## Usage

### What you need

* ESPHome compatible microcontroller
* cable with RJ12 connector (phone cable, RJ11 may also work)

### Wiring

#### RJ12

Please double check this for your specific model!

pin | function
----|---------
 1  | NC (pulled up)
 2  | GND
 3  | TX
 4  | VCC
 5  | RX
 6  | NC (pulled up)

Sometime the Desk Controller does not supply enough current, then simply disconnet the VCC pin and plug in a micro-usb/usb-c cable into your esp-board.  

## Usage

```yaml
substitutions:
  pin_tx: GPIO3
  pin_rx: GPIO4

esphome:
  ...
  on_boot:
    # This script is required to initialize the following sensors:
    #    height_abs, height_pct, height_min, height_max, position_m1 - position_m4
    # You can skip this if you don't use those.
    priority: 0 # when mostly everything else is done
    then:
      - lambda: "id(my_desk).request_physical_limits();"
      - delay: 0.1s
      - lambda: "id(my_desk).request_limits();"
      - delay: 0.1s
      - lambda: "id(my_desk).request_settings();"

### Features

#### sensors

sensor       | description
-------------|----------------------------
height_abs   | current height of the desk
height_pct   | height in percent
height_min   | minimal height
height_max   | maximal height
position_m1  | 1st stored height
position_m2  | 2nd stored height
position_m3  | 3rd stored height
position_m4  | 4th stored height

####  number entities

Hold current values read from the desk and set values to desk when changed.
