# ESPHome Panasonic Heatpump Component

## Usage

### What you need

* ESPHome compatible microcontroller (e.g. ESP8266, ESP32, ESP32-S2, ESP32-C3, ...)
* ADUM1201 Dual Channel Digital Magnetic Isolator  
  (to convert 5V UART signal from the heatpump to 3.3V UART signal of the ESP controller)
* CN-CNT cable/connectors to Heatpump/CZ-TAW1 (see [Heishamon](https://github.com/Egyras/HeishaMon) github site for more information)
  * For example: [S05B-XASK-1 JST Connector](https://a.aliexpress.com/_EvkmGVo)
  * For example: [XAP-05V-1 5Pin Cable with Female to Female Connector](https://a.aliexpress.com/_ExPT82E)

### Wiring

### CN-CNT Pinout (from top to bottom)

pin | function
----|---------
1   | +5V (250mA)
2   | 0-5V TX (from heatpump)
3   | 0-5V RX (to heatpump)
4   | NC (not connected)
5   | GND

## ESPHome example yaml code

```yaml
substitutions:
  pin_rx_hp: GPIO37  # heatpump reads data (RX) on this pin    (yellow)
  pin_tx_hp: GPIO39  # heatpump sends data (TX) on this pin    (green)
  pin_tx_wm: GPIO18  # WiFi module sends data (TX) on this pin (white)
  pin_rx_wm: GPIO16  # WiFi module reads data (RX) on this pin (blue)

## Configuration variables

- **id** (*Optional*, ID): Manually specify the ID used for actions.
- **update_interval** (*Optional*, Time): The interval of the polling request message to get the heatpump values. This time applies only if no `uart_client_id` is set. Defaults to 3s.
- **uart_id** (Optional, ID): Manually specify the UART ID of the Heatpump. Required if multiple UART buses are defined.
- **uart_client_id** (*Optional*, ID): Manually specify the UART ID of an additonal UART client like the Panasonic CZ-TAW1. If this ID is not set then your ESP controller will send the polling request messages.
- **log_uart_msg** (*Optional*, boolean): Shows the raw UART messages in the logs, if set to `true`. The messages will be written to the log level `INFO`. Defaults to false.

## Custom Entities (For Advanced Users)

If you review the [ProtocolByteDecrypt.md](https://github.com/Egyras/HeishaMon/blob/master/ProtocolByteDecrypt.md) file you will find also some TOPs and SETs which are not implemented yet in heishamon.  
They are usually marked as TOP (without a number).  
The nice part of ESPHome is that it is so highly customizeable.  
So if you want some additional TOP or SET entities you can easily create your own.  
Under the hood the received uart message from the heatpump is stored in a vector,  
so you can decode each byte by yourself.  
Here an example how to create a sensor and a text_sensor:

```yaml
panasonic_heatpump:
  id: my_heatpump

sensor:
  - platform: template
    name: "Dry concrete target temperature for actual stage"
    update_interval: 3s
    device_class: temperature
    unit_of_measurement: °C
    lambda: |-
      // get the requried byte
      int byte = my_heatpump->getResponseByte(46);
      // a valid byte range is 0x00-0xFF
      // do not update if the byte is invalid
      if (byte < 0) return {};
      // convert the byte (see HeishaMon/ProtocolByteDecrypt.md)
      // in this case -128
      return byte - 128;

text_sensor:
  - platform: template
    name: "DHW capacity (J-series only)"
    update_interval: 3s
    lambda: |-
      // get the requried byte
      int byte = my_heatpump->getResponseByte(9);
      // a valid byte range is 0x00-0xFF
      // do not update if the byte is invalid
      if (byte < 0) return {};
      // convert the byte (see HeishaMon/ProtocolByteDecrypt.md)
      // in this case 3rd and 4th bit (--> b0011 0000)
      int state = ((byte >> 4) & 0b11) - 1;
      // set text
      if (state == 0) return { "Standard" };
      if (state == 1) return { "DHW" };
      // if state is unkown do not update
      return {};
```

## Known Issues

When the ESP controller is connected initially to the heatpump (and the heatpump is powered),  
the heatpump may not respond to any request messages.  
If the CZ-TAW1 is also connected to the ESP controller you will probably see some requests like 0x31 05 10 01 ...  
These are initial request messages.  
If the heatpump is not responding, it may help to turn off and on the power of the heatpump (switching the heatpump off is not enough).  
After a power on the heatpump should respond to the requests.
